# Intro-to-Deep-Learning-with-MNIST-Data
This repo is part of Data Science Club where I introduced how to create a simple neural network from scratch using MNIST dataset. <br>

- Taught about rescaling of images and the architecture of CNN (Conv2D layer, maxpool layer, Flatten layer). 

- I also discussed about the 3 things for compiling a model namely using a loss function (Sparse_category_cross_entropy), optimizer (stochastic gradient descent), and metrics (accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix). 

- At end, I introduced to them the concept of early stopping to prevent overfitting and visualizing the confusion matrix.
